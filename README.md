# Big 2

## ***What will the application do?***

There are many different applications with their variations of Big 2, however, this application has its own version of
the game. Similar to the normal game of Big 2, each player will be dealt a hand of cards. The number of cards per hand 
will depend on the number of players. However, unlike the normal game, this application will allow for more than 4 
people to play at a time with the use of multiple decks of cards. The user can also choose to either deal all the cards
out or play with only 13 cards per player.

There are 9 different types of hands that are possible to be played:
- Single
- Pairs
- Three of a kind
- Straight
- Flush
- Full house
- Four of a kind
- Straight flush
- Royal straight flush

With the last 6 hands being 5 card hands (they are played in sets of 5 cards).

There are also chips to either be won or lost:
- White chips are worth 1 point
- Blue chips are worth 5 points
- Red chips are worth 10 points
- Gold chips are worth 25 points

At the end of each game, the amount of cards each player has left in their hand is equivalent to the number of points 
that they lose with the except of the 2. If the play still has a 2 in their hand, that card is worth 5 points (ie. they 
lose an extra 4 points on top).

## ***Who will use it?***

This application is for anyone who enjoys playing card games--especially Big 2--and perhaps want to try a different 
version of it. Since there is no actual gambling involved, it is for any age range.

## ***Why is this project of interest to you?***

I wanted to created this game because this version of playing Big 2 is something that my family always played whenever 
we had family dinners or gatherings. There were always more than four people who wanted to play so we had to use two 
decks of cards instead of one. My aunt is also a creative person who enjoys altering the rules of games and making her 
own games as well, thus, the new rules for how chips are paid. Being able to make something that my family "created" 
--or rather altered I guess--into an actual game would be fun and interesting.
